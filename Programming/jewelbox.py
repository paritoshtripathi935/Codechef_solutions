# minimal space utilization.
#  he used his unique but complex way of representation for tracking the gems, as follows:
# For each gem, the count is maintained and displayed against each gem (except count 1).
# For each Box, if the gems proportionate quantity is the multiple of a number, then that is displayed after the box closes.

# In the kingdom of K king, there are 5 unique sized Jewel Boxes represented as (Biggest) $, %, &, # and * (Smallest) with closing lids as ; : , . and + respectively. E
# Each of the jewel boxes contains gems numbered as A, B, C, Dâ€¦ Z. 

# Sample Input 2:
# $A4%BC&XB3,2:3;

# Sample Output 2:
# A4B21C3X6

# Now, you need to simplify and count the total number of unique treasures and show them in output in sorted order (according to gems).
